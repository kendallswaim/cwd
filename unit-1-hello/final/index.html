	<!-- The style of my webpage is inspired by a late 90s fandom webpage; simple and laid back. I wanted to keep my writing style laid back as well to fit the theme of the page. The color choices of yellow, red, and blue, come from Family Guy's colors. The borders around the paragraphs and the images separating the the boxes was a personal choice, I like the look of everything having its own section. I included the question box at the end because I think it sells the idea of this being an early webpage of someone looking for a community in their fandom.  -->

	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p class="double">I have been watching Family Guy since I was in middle school and the show would run on Adult Swim. Now, I am 21 years old and I watch Family Guy every day. I watch the show when I am bored, doing my makeup, eating, and trying to fall asleep. I even did my senior seminar research study on political satire in Family Guy. Family Guy is my favorite show.</p>

	<h1>My Favorite Characters</h1>
	<p class="double">My two favorite characters and Stewie and Brian. They bring out the best in each other. They always participate in crazy antics like trying to save Christmas or visiting Ann Murray's house. Stewie and Brian represent true friendship.</p>

	<h1>My Favorite Episodes</h1>
	<p class="double">My favorite episode is S9E1: "And Then There Were Fewer". This episode is a parody of the novel "And Then There Were None" by Agatha Christie. This episode brings together many characters that we do not usually get to see in the same scenes. The episode is entertaining and mysterious, yet it is still hilarious.</p>
